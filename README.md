## ▶️ How to Run  

1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
````

Navigate into the repo folder:

cd your-repo-name


Compile and run any project, e.g.:

javac Hangman.java
java Hangman

📝 Notes

All programs are beginner-friendly and serve as practice projects.

Each file runs independently.

Future improvements may include GUI versions and integration into larger apps.





2. Navigate into the repo folder:

   ```bash
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

3. Run any script with Python, for example:

   ```bash
   python guessing_game.py
   ```

## 📝 Notes

* Each script is standalone unless otherwise stated.
* Most programs are **console-based** and require user input.
* Future updates may include unit tests, refactoring, and combining smaller scripts into larger applications.

👉 Do you want me to **combine both Java + Python projects into one “master README”** (if they’re in the same repo), or keep each language repo with its own README?
